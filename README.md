#### **Game Description:**

Amoebash is a roguelike game where you play as the nucleus of a brain-eating amoeba with one goal: to infect a human being. You start by going through a person’s nose, and you’ll need to swim, dash, and slash through your opponents while facing various challenges, with the final goal of reaching the brain. If you make it to the end, you face off against a multi-segment  Neuron Dragon that uses Electric Attacks to stop you. Chip away at the dragon segment by segment and you might just get the glory of taking over a human!

Throughout your journey, you’ll face off against hordes of enemies in procedurally generated dungeon floors, with each one getting harder and harder. Don’t worry though; each enemy you defeat has a chance of dropping buffs to strengthen yourself during your run. You’ll be able to get new weapons or power ups, which will help you later in the game.

Don’t sweat it if the Neuron Dragon or any other enemies get the best of you—just retreat and regroup! On your way out, you get to keep at least one buff you collected for the next run through a “Nucleus Menu”. You might’ve stumbled upon a powerful buff, giving you an edge for your next daring attempt, which means a good run is never wasted!

Each enemy can also give you “Germoney”, which you can use in the Shop to buy new buffs, or increase how many buffs you can keep when you die.
